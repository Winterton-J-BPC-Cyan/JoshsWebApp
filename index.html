<h1>Welcome to my first web app</h1>
This is my first test website using Microsoft azure.
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  	Python while not being mainly used as a website language can and will still run on a web server and even with fewer lines of code. Python as a programming language is quick, making it perfect for getting things online quickly for better marketing. The main focus however is on pythons readability and format, which makes it a perfect language for beginners.
  <li>Java</li>
	Java, which is a sub language of C++, has a tonne of add-on software components. The most basic aspect of Java is that its a variation of C++ with an easier to learn overall flow in how it works, how it runs, how its made, etc. This makes it alot easier for beginners to learn if they want to learn the basic premise of C++ without all the complication. Java is one of the best for higher level applications, popular sites, and even Android apps. Even popular sites like Twitter, Verizon and AT&T use java.
  <li>PHP</li>
  	PHP is the most popular server side language and is the most commonly used. PHP is designed to pull and edit information within the database. It’s commonly complemeted with databases written in the SQL language. PHP was designed soley for the web and still upholds that idea today. It’s easy to use and run.
  <li>C++</li>
  	C++ is a complex applications that is built on the .NET Framework. C++ is a dificuly but high-powered programming language that works well for websites with larger amounts of data. Speed is C++'s main language, and it runs well alongside other languages. Examples of well compatible languages are Java and Python.
